            <h1> About US </h1>
            <p> All Seasons Ice Cream was founded in 1997 by the Roberts family. They started off with only three flavors: vanilla, chocolate, and strawberry. As time passed and they had more money to build upon their small family business they expanded their franchise and started creating more flavors. Now they are international with their ice cream flavors.
